This is a simple project created as part of Class 8 Activity 1 to introduce the concepts of Git repositories, GitHub, and connecting HTML and JavaScript files.
The project displays a "Hello World" alert as soon as the `index.html` page is loaded, demonstrating that the `script.js` file is correctly linked and executed.
